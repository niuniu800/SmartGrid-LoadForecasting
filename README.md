# 🔌 SmartGrid-LoadForecasting

Power load forecasting using deep learning models: a comparative study of Transformer and Mamba architectures for smart grid applications.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on short-term electric load forecasting for smart grids using two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures:

- **Transformer**: A self-attention-based model capable of capturing short-term dependencies in time series.
- **Mamba + KAN**: A novel state space model enhanced with Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN) for modeling complex, nonlinear, and long-range temporal dependencies.

Both models are implemented in PyTorch and trained on real-world power grid data (`quanzhou.csv`), aiming to improve load prediction accuracy under nonstationary and highly dynamic conditions.

## 🧠 Model Architectures

### ⚙️ Transformer
- Encoder-decoder structure (3 layers each)
- Multi-head attention (4 heads)
- Layer normalization, residual connections
- Fully connected output for single-step regression

### ⚙️ Mamba + KAN
- State Space Modeling (SSM) with Selective Scan mechanism
- KANLinear layers for flexible nonlinear activations
- Captures long-term dependencies and sharp load transitions
- Includes early stopping to avoid overfitting

## 📊 Experimental Results

Both models were trained on the same dataset and evaluated using standard metrics:

| Model       | R²     | MAE      | RMSE     | MAPE    |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Transformer | 0.8529 | 590.52   | 759.94   | 6.64%   |
| Mamba       | 0.9814 | 169.39   | 269.92   | 2.05%   |

Mamba showed superior performance in all metrics, especially under rapid load fluctuations. It also better fits actual trends and generalizes more robustly.
